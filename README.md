# Java-UdaSecurity


**![UdaSecurity Logo](UdaSecurity.png)**

This is a home security application that tracks the status of sensors, monitors camera feeds, and adjusts the systemâ€™s alarm status based on the inputs. 
Users can arm and disarm the system whether they are at home or away

## Introduce

or if a cat is detected, an alarm will also go off.

## Directory Structure
